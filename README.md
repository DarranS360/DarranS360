## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
```python
about_me = input("Would you like to know about me and this project?\n").lower()

if about_me == "yes" or "no": 
    print("""Regardless of what you picked I'm going to tell you anyway! Hi, my name is Darran. I have been recently 
given a push to change careers to something I love doing in my spare time...coding and programming! I know the journey 
won't be a breeze, and will have ups and downs (changing careers is scary), but I know I will thoroughly enjoy it!

The whole point of this GitHub for now is to showcase all the bits of code and programmes I have written in the hopes 
that one day it'll be super professional.""")
